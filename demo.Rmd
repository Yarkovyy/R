This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.




```{r}

# Наш перший скрипт

x <- seq(0, 2, 0.1)
y <- x^3+2*x+3
plot(x, y,
     type = "b",
     col = "red",
     main = "Звичайний графік",
     xlab = "Вісь X",
     ylab = "Вісь Y"
     )
points(x, y + 0.7)
lines(x, y-0.7)


x <- seq(-pi, pi, 0.1)
y1 <- sin(x)
y2 <- dnorm(x)

plot(x, y1, type="l", col = "red")
lines(x, 3 * y2, col = "green")
grid()

```




```{python}

x=3
x**3

```
